When opening or creating a font with Fontra, the default view is now the font overview. Double-clicking glyphs in the overview leads the user to an editor view.

<div class="alert alert-primary mt-3" role="alert" markdown='1'>
#### Pro tip
{: .alert-heading}
one can open multiple tabs or windows for the same font, by copying the URL into a new tab or window. It is possible to have multiple font overviews or glyph editors open for the same font.
{: .mb-0 }
</div>

The left sidebar contains several user interface elements to help viewing the glyphs in the font in an organized way. For example, one can group the glyphs by script. The sections in the overview are collapsable. Alt-click on a section header collapses all sections. Or expands all, if all are collapsed.

Glyph filtering is still somewhat limited: while you can quickly filter by glyph name in the search box, we anticipate additional filtering options in the future. We notice that early adopters are enthusiastically proposing additional features.

In general, the options provide a "view" on the font's collection of glyphs. Changing the options does not change anything about the font itself, just how we look at it.
