Glyph selection
---------------

Use the [pointer tool] to select / deselect glyphs.

Only one glyph can be selected at a time. Attributes of the glyph are loaded into the [glyph info panel](#) and into the [designspace panel](#).

Glyph editing
-------------

#### Activating editing mode

Double-click a glyph to activate the *editing mode* for that glyph. In place of a 'black' preview shape, you will now see an outline representation of the bézier contours with points and handles.

#### Measuring distances

Use the [measurement tool] to measure distances between points along the contour.

#### Editing contours and components

Use the [pointer tool] to select and move contours, segments points, handles, components.

Use the [pen tool] to draw new contours and add points to existing contours.

Fontra supports cubic and quadratic outlines. Quadratic outlines can be activated in the [options panel].

You can use the standard keyboard shortcuts ⌘ Z to undo the last actions, and ⇧ ⌘ Z to redo them.
