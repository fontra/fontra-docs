Fontra is an open-source, browser-based, cross-platform, variable-first font editor. It is developed by Black[Foundry] and Just van Rossum with support from Google.

Fontra extends the boudaries of what current font editors can do. Originally developed to make the design and production of large <abr title="fonts with a large range of Chinese / Japanese / Korean characters">CJK fonts</abr> more efficient, Fontra provides deeper integration of variable font technology and improved usability of variable components as design elements.

Fontra is different from most other editors because it works in the browser. Using the [Fontra Pak](#) application, you can run Fontra locally to edit files on your computer. Fontra can also be used remotely from a server, allowing collaboration in real-time between multiple users.
