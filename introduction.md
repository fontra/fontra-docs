Fontra is an open-source browser-based cross-platform variable-first font editor. It is developed by Black[Foundry] and Just van Rossum with support from Google.

Fontra extends the boudaries of what current font editors can do. Originally developed to make the design and production of large CJK fonts more efficient, Fontra provides deeper integration of variable font technology and improved usability of variable components as design elements.

Fontra is different from most other editors because it works in the browser. Using the Fontra Pak application, you can run Fontra locally to edit files on your computer.  or remotely on a server, allowing collaboration real-time between multiple users.
